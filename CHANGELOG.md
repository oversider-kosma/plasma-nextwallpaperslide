# changelog

Notable changes to [plasma-applet-nextwallpaperslide](https://github.com/oversider-kosma/plasma-nextwallpaperslide).



## [2.1] - 2020-03-31

### Changed
- At the moment, there should be no performance problems, regardless of the size of the wallpaper set or the location of the plasmoid if kwin is used as a window manager (not guaranted for compiz or other).


## [2.0] - 2020-03-17

### Changed
- Partly refactored to fix performance issues on large wallpaper sets. Issues should be gone for plasmoid located directly at the desktop. When the plasmoid is located on the panel, the issue, unfortunately, is still present.


## [1.0] - 2020-03-03

### Add
- Initial implementation
